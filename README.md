## Upload a file to your Web via HTTP\. Now supporting binary files


</div>

### Description

This code uploads a file to an ASP script using http post. It can be used to automatically upload files without user interaction, e.g. when you want to publish some data to your Web site periodically.

There are lots of code excerpts around describing the receiving side but the sending side is mostly an HTML page containing INPUT TYPE="File" ... Simulating this by code requires some knowledge of HTTP Post and Mime.

Find the full project and the ASP in the ZIP.

New!!! Now shows how to upload a .gif file. Other binary files work similar.
 
### More Info
 
The project uses the XMLHTTPRequest object in Microsoft XML 3.0. The version 2.0 didn't work for this.
